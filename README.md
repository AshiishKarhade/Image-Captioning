# Image-Captioning
Image Captioning Project

I made this Image Captioning project which is quite similar to Microsoft's [CaptionBot.ai](http://captionbot.ai). Although [CaptionBot.ai](http://captionbot.ai) is much more powerful and accuracy is a lot more than my model.

I made a web app with Flask Framework to upload any photo and get relevant caption for it.

### Built With

* [Tensorflow](http://tensorflow.org) 
* [Keras](https://keras.io)
* [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com)

### Used
* InceptionV3 Model trained on [ImageNet](http://www.image-net.org)
* LSTM Layers
* RNN Layers
* Trained on 30,000 Images by [Flickr30k dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/hsankesara/flickr-image-dataset)
